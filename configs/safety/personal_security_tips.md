# Personal Security Tips for OSINT Investigators

## Physical Security

### Device Security
- Use dedicated devices for OSINT work when possible
- Enable full-disk encryption on all devices
- Set up automatic screen locking (1-2 minutes)
- Use privacy screens when working in public
- Cover webcams when not in use
- Consider using USB data blockers when charging from public ports

### Workspace Security
- Maintain a clean desk policy 
- Position screens away from windows and doorways
- Be aware of shoulder surfing in public spaces
- Secure devices when stepping away
- Consider using a privacy filter on laptop screens

### Traveling Security
- Keep devices with you at all times
- Use a VPN before connecting to any network
- Avoid public Wi-Fi when possible, use phone tethering
- Turn off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi when not in use
- Consider using a Faraday bag for sensitive devices when not in use
- Be aware of local laws regarding encryption and VPNs

## Digital Security

### Authentication
- Use a password manager for unique, complex passwords
- Enable 2FA on all accounts (preferably app-based, not SMS)
- Use hardware security keys when possible
- Consider a separate authentication system for OSINT accounts
- Regularly audit login sessions and revoke unknown devices

### Operational Account Segregation
- Never use personal accounts for OSINT work
- Create dedicated email accounts for different investigation categories
- Use different browsers for different online identities
- Consider using virtual machines for different investigations
- Avoid cross-contamination between personal and OSINT accounts

### Browser Security
- Use hardened browsers (Firefox with privacy extensions or Tor Browser)
- Install essential extensions:
  - uBlock Origin (ad/tracker blocking)
  - Privacy Badger (tracker blocking)
  - HTTPS Everywhere (force encrypted connections)
  - NoScript (JavaScript control)
  - Cookie AutoDelete (automatic cookie removal)
- Regularly clear browsing data
- Disable WebRTC, geolocation, and third-party cookies
- Consider using containerized browsing

### Network Security
- Always use a VPN or Tor for sensitive research
- Use DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) or DNS-over-TLS (DoT)
- Consider DNS filtering services
- Set up a separate research network if working from home
- Regularly check for unusual network activity
- Use MAC address spoofing when appropriate

## Counterintelligence Awareness

### Digital Footprint Minimization
- Regularly monitor your own digital footprint
- Remove unnecessary personal information from public sites
- Use services like DeleteMe or Privacy Duck to remove public records
- Check data broker sites for your information and opt out
- Minimize social media presence or use pseudonymous accounts

### Social Engineering Defense
- Be skeptical of unexpected contact from strangers
- Verify identities through secondary channels
- Be aware of pretexting and impersonation attempts
- Limit personal information shared online
- Remember that seemingly innocuous information can be used for targeting

### Technical Surveillance Awareness
- Be aware of your surroundings when discussing sensitive matters
- Know the signs of potential device compromise:
  - Unexpected battery drain
  - Device running hot when idle
  - Unusual network activity
  - Strange sounds during calls
  - Unexpected device behavior
- Regularly sweep for unauthorized software
- Consider occasional RF sweeps in sensitive locations

## Psychological Security

### Stress Management
- Establish clear work/life boundaries
- Take regular breaks during intense research
- Practice digital detox periods
- Have regular check-ins with colleagues or supervisors
- Be aware of signs of burnout and compassion fatigue

### Desensitization Protection
- Be aware of the psychological impact of exposure to disturbing content
- Use techniques to maintain emotional distance from content
- Develop healthy coping mechanisms
- Seek professional support when needed
- Consider content warnings for colleagues when sharing disturbing findings

### Threat Response Planning
- Have a plan for various threats (online harassment, doxxing, physical threats)
- Establish emergency contacts
- Document any concerning incidents
- Know when to involve law enforcement
- Have legal resources available

## Emergency Procedures

### Compromise Recovery
- Have a plan for device compromise
- Keep backup secure communication channels
- Know how to properly isolate compromised systems
- Maintain secure backups of critical data
- Practice recovery procedures periodically

### Documentation
- Document all security incidents
- Keep logs of unusual activity
- Maintain a threat journal if needed
- Record patterns of suspicious behavior
- Share information appropriately with security team

## Remember
- Security is a process, not a product
- Balance security measures with operational needs
- Regularly review and update security practices
- Learn from incidents and near-misses
- Share security knowledge with colleagues

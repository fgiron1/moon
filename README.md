A comprehensive, containerized framework for secure and organized Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) operations.

## üåü Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Extensible design with separate modules for different OSINT tasks
- **Containerized Tools**: Pre-configured security tools in isolated containers
- **Secure by Default**: Built-in security measures for safe operations
- **Data Management**: Organized storage and export of collected intelligence
- **Network Privacy**: Advanced routing and VPN integration
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive terminal-based menu system

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Linux-based OS (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- 4GB+ RAM (8GB recommended)
- 20GB+ free disk space
- Root/sudo access

## üöÄ Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Linux-based OS (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended)
- Python 3.8+
- Ansible
- SSH access to target servers (if deploying remotely)

### Local Installation

For a local development or testing environment:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/moon.git
   cd moon
   ```

2. **Set up the environment**:
   ```bash
   # Create required directories
   sudo mkdir -p /opt/osint/{data,tools,config}
   sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /opt/osint
   
   # Set up data directories
   mkdir -p /opt/osint/data/{targets,exports,reports,logs}
   ```

3. **Build and start the containers**:
   ```bash
   # Build all containers
   sudo ./core/containers/manager.sh build all
   
   # Start all containers
   sudo ./core/containers/manager.sh start all
   ```

4. **Access the terminal interface**:
   ```bash
   sudo ./ui/terminal/main.sh
   ```

### Production Deployment

For production deployments, use the automated deployment script:

1. **Clone the repository** on your management machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/moon.git
   cd moon
   ```

2. **Install Ansible** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y ansible
   ```

3. **Configure the inventory**:
   Edit `deploy/ansible/inventory/osint_servers.yml` to specify your target servers.

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   Copy the example environment file and update it with your configuration:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   nano .env  # Update with your settings
   ```

5. **Run the deployment script**:
   ```bash
   sudo ./deploy/scripts/deploy.sh
   ```
   
   This will:
   - Generate SSH keys if needed
   - Run Ansible playbooks to configure the system
   - Set up containers and services
   - Configure networking and security

6. **Verify the deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Check container status
   sudo ./core/containers/manager.sh status
   
   # Check network configuration
   sudo ./core/network/control.sh status
   ```
